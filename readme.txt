Easy to use Wordpress plugin to insert Google Adsense to your posts, pages and sidebar.

== Description ==
Use this plugin to quickly and easily insert Google Adsense to your posts, pages and sidebar by using a trigger text or calling the php function.

There are many plugins and services which can add Google Adsense to your Wordpress site. However I found that even though something like Adsense Manager or Adsense Deluxe provides a lot of customizable options, it can be overwhelming and isn't really simple enough for people who are new to WordPress.

I found that most of the time I only use two or three types of Google Adsense units in various places and posts throughout my sites.That's why I wrote my own Adsense WoW Plugin for WordPress, to focus on having 1-3 Google Adsense codes saved and use them where ever I want on my site by inserting a simple trigger text to my posts,pages and sidebar.
